                    p Reading time:

                    p For the next three months - April, May and June - our team is going on a journey to find out whether people are having issues with fair equity calculations and proper allocation amongst participants.  It is an exciting and crucial time as this exercise will help us determine if there is a need for an equity split solution. Fun times!
                    p The goal: 
                        strong understand if there is a problem that can be solved
                    p The approach: interview 30 business owners, 30 minutes long interview with each individual to get a sense of problems they experience with equity ownership, ask for 2-3 referrals, and incorporate feedback into prototype.
                    p Questions that we will going to answer through interviews are:
                        ul
                            li
                                strong Is there an equity problem worth solving?
                            li
                                strong How is this problem being addressed by business owners at the moment?
                            li
                                strong Is there a market fit for the equity split solution?
                    p Framework: We are using the strategyzer.comâ€™s value proposition framework which captures customer jobs, pains and gains.
                    p The concept is simple.  We ask business/start up founders to rank three pains related to equity calculation within the business, describe how they address these difficulties and what is done to achieve the desired outcome.  Identified pains will demonstrate if there is a recurring problem that businesses and startups are experiencing on an ongoing basis.  Approaches used to address an equity split problems, as identified by the founders, will be used to create a solution in order to fairly track equity ownership.
                    p This framework is great at addressing ambiguity and helps to structure our discoveries. Loving it!
